// Package survey takes stock of the site's IP addresses: which have a
// BACnet device, which have some other host, and which are vacant. It is
// the bacnet-survey utility, running on the shifter's own site client
// rather than a client of its own, so that the shifter finds the devices
// no Who-Is reaches: on a subnet whose broadcasts are filtered, behind a
// BBMD the shifter is not registered with, or too old to announce
// themselves.
//
// It tries every address with one ReadProperty of the Device object's
// identifier through the wildcard instance, after a broadcast Who-Is. A
// device that answers, or that declines as one older than the wildcard
// instance does, or whose I-Am is heard, is a BACnet device, and is read
// for its name, vendor and model.
//
// Whether anything is at the other addresses is told two ways. On the
// adapter's own subnet the operating system's neighbor table says: sending
// to an address there makes the system resolve it by ARP, which a host
// answers whether or not it answers anything else, so an address with a MAC
// in the table is a host's, and one without is vacant. Beyond the subnet,
// reached through a router, each address is pinged as well: a reply is a
// host, and a router's answer that the host is unreachable means it found
// nobody there by ARP, so the address is vacant. An address that answers
// nothing at all is only silent: vacant, or a host that ignores both.
//
// To the network a survey looks like a port scan of UDP 47808, and every
// vacant address on the subnet costs an ARP broadcast.
